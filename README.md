# Cat's jazz
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/MwQmDBmuqk4
#### Description:
My project is a browser game built in HTML5 using Pixi JS engine (The new version has been rewritten in Vanilla JavaScript). The genre of this game is a classic hidden object puzzle adventure. The key goal is to find five cats hidden in the room.

The main code of the program is located in game.js file and written in JavaScript programming language with Pixi JS framework (now without). Ten cats are described in the code and depicted in the supporting materials, but when you launch the game only five cats will be randomly chosen and shown on the screen. When you click on any cat, it will meow, light up, jump up and disappear. At the same time, at the top right corner of the screen, a pink cat head will be shown as an indicator of the found cat. The game will be over when you find all five hidden cats, but there is also an option to relaunch the game and start looking again.

The template of the site is located in index.html file. The style of the game canvas and background is described in style.css file. Also, there are two sound files and a folder with the game pictures.

That's the whole project! Enjoy yourself. Letâ€™s find them all ;)
